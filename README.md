In this project, I performed an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python and SQL. I downloaded a dataset using the Kaggle API, processed and cleaned the data using Python (Pandas), and loaded the cleaned data into SQL Server for further analysis. I then designed and executed SQL queries to extract meaningful insights. This project showcases my ability to manage data pipelines and apply analytical techniques to answer business-related questions.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

**1.	Download Dataset using Kaggle API:**
•	The dataset, named "Retail Orders," was downloaded using the Kaggle API.

•	Required authentication setup using the Kaggle JSON token.

**2.	Data Cleaning and Processing in Python (Pandas):**

•	Loaded the dataset into a Jupyter notebook using Pandas.

•	Performed data cleaning: handling missing values, renaming columns, and correcting data types.

•	Created new columns and performed necessary transformations for better analysis.

**3.	Load Data into SQL Server:**

•	Connected to SQL Server and loaded the cleaned dataset into SQL tables for further analysis.

**4.	SQL Analysis:**

•	Designed and executed multiple SQL queries (5-6) to answer specific business-related questions

•	These queries focused on key retail metrics such as sales performance, order trends, and customer behavior.
